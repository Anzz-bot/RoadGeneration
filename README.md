About 
--------
Simulation is a valuable building block for the verification and validation of automated driving functions (ADF). When simulating urban driving scenarios, simulation maps are one important component. Often, the generation of those road networks is a time consuming and manual effort. Furthermore, typically many variations of a distinct junction or road section are demanded to ensure that an ADF can be validated in the process of releasing those functions to the public.
Therefore, we present a prototypical solution for a logical road network description which is easy to maintain and modify. The concept aims to be non-redundant so that changes of distinct quantities do not affect other places in the code and thus the variation of maps is straightforward. In addition, the simple definition of junctions is a focus of the work. Intersecting roads are defined separately and then set in relation, finally a junction is generated automatically.
The idea is to derive the description from a commonly used, standardized format for simulation maps in order to generate this format from the introduced logical description. Consequently, we developed a command-line tool that generates the standardized simulation map format OpenDRIVE.

Overview
--------
This repository provides a tool for the generation of road networkds. Here, the main folders are named:

- `io`: contains some sample input files
- `doc`: contains the code and xsd input file documentation and the seminar thesis
- `libs`: contains the pugixml library
- `src`: contains the source code
- `xml`: contains the xsd validation files 
- `variation`: contains the variation project


Installation
------------

The following requirements have to be satisfied:

- ``C++11``
- ``CMake 2.6 or higher``
- ``Python 3.6``
- ``xercesC``

Download the repository as a zip-file and un-zip, or use git with

```bash
    # Clone Repository and open main folder
    git clone git@github.com:ika-rwth-aachen/RoadGeneration.git
    cd road-generation
```

A build script is provided and can be executed with

```bash
sh buildScript.sh
```

Alternatively you can build the project manually:

<details><summary><b>Install on Linux</b></summary>

1. Install [`xercesC`](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/):
    You can use a packet manager
    ```bash
    sudo apt install libxerces-c-dev
    ```
    Or download the source directly
    ```bash
    curl https://mirrors.gigenet.com/apache//xerces/c/3/sources/xerces-c-3.2.3.tar.gz --output xerces-c-3.2.3.tar.gz
    ```
    and unpack it with
    ```bash
    gzip -d xerces-c-3.2.3.tar.gz
    tar -xf xerces-c-3.2.3.tar
    ```
    Finally build the source files as instructed [here](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/build-3.html).

2. Build the Road-generation tool
```bash
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../bin ..
    cmake --build .
```
</details>


Usage
---------------

For usage the compiled application can be called from the ``PROJ_DIR`` folder:

```bash
    ./roadGeneration <input>
```

This generates the output XML file in the folder of the input file. The provided input file is checked against the ``input.xsd`` file. Analogous the output file is checked against the ``output.xsd`` file specifying the current openDRIVE standard.



Documentation
-------------
A simple but well designed code documentation is provided by using [`Doxygen`](http://www.doxygen.nl/).
```bash 
    cd doc/
    doxygen doxygenDocumentation.doxy
    open doxygenDocumentation/html/index.html
```
An documentation for the input file of the tool can be generated by the following. It is based on the [`xs3p`](https://xml.fiforms.org/xs3p/) style guide.

```bash
    cd doc/
    ./xsdDocumentation.sh
```


Variation tool
------------
The Variation tool is used to generate a variety of different scenarios based on the same general road network. A template file is provided to specify variables aswell as the general road network structure.



Further Work
------------

* specific road markings
* documentation for the input file
